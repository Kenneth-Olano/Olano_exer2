Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. Go to settings of your repo
2. Go to the Pages section and change the branch to the branch that contains your code. This is where you will publish your site, and save.
3. Refresh the page and the link will be ready from the Page section of the Settings.
What are your key takeaways from this exercise? I need to practice on HTML and CSS, as well as Git and Github.
